          <h1>Simple Project For Mastering My Flexbox</h1>
          <p>
            Building this project has really helped my understanding of flexbox
            and its many use cases. Although i understand floats, I think
            flexbox is a better option for layouts. Fewer commands and speedy
            results are some of the qualities of this important CSS tool.
            Hopefully, I can add this new found knowledge to my future 100Devs
            assignment.
