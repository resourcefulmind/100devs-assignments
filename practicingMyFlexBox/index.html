            Nothing to see here, just a software engineer trying to spread love
            to his woman as an excuse for always spending time on his PC.
            Imagine you are a software engineer and want your girl to read your
            thoughts whenever she thinks about you. Only problem is, you cannot
            be with her for as long as you want because first, you are separated
            by the Atlantic Ocean and secondly, you have to work to make a
            future for yourself. Lucky for you, there's tech and she can always
            click a button and see the beautiful messages you leave for her at
            any time of the day.
